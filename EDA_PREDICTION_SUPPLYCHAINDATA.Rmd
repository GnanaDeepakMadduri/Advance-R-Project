## INTRODUCTION

In today's world, e-commerce entities serve as catalysts for economic growth by augmenting productivity, fostering innovation, and enhancing the overall shopping experience. The act of purchasing goods in large quantities online has become ubiquitous. As customers assume a central position in the company's priorities, their expectations regarding product quality, shipping, delivery times, and other related aspects have amplified. The concept of online shopping has transformed into a customer centric experience. Due to intense competition and a rapidly evolving market, companies that do not adapt promptly face the risk of becoming obsolete. Therefore, the primary objective of this project is to comprehend the impact of various factors such as location, shipping mode, distance, etc., on delivery status. A thorough analysis of this data will aid in minimizing the likelihood of late deliveries.

Fraud can occur at any point in the supply chain, from the initial order placement to the final delivery of goods. Fraudulent activities such as false orders, theft, and counterfeit products can negatively impact the company's reputation, financial health, and customer trust. Therefore, it is crucial for DataCo to have an effective fraud detection system in place to minimize the risks associated with fraudulent activities. The purpose of this document is to provide the methods used to detect fraud, and the procedures in place to investigate and respond to fraudulent activities.


## MOTIVATION AND OVERVIEW

The supply chain industry holds a significant position in determining the overall economic health of the world. The onset of the pandemic in late 2019 resulted in businesses being left with an abundance of unsold goods, leading to a temporary surge in inventory-to-sales ratios before liquidation took place. Although the economy has made a significant recovery and demand has increased, businesses have not been able to restore their inventories to pre-pandemic levels, causing a decrease in inventory-to-sales ratios, leading to an inflation of prices for products and services. These supply chain disruptions extend beyond hardware or manufacturing shortages, as we have witnessed shortages in various household items, including common grocery items. Given the massive amount of data available from point-of-sale to online transactions, an advanced approach to analyzing and predicting the future state of supply chain operations would be beneficial to both businesses and customers. Boosting revenue is one of the key factors that can curb inflation, which is currently a global issue. Thus, when business revenues increase, it leads to an increase in employment, ultimately raising the Nation's GDP.


## RELATED WORK

One area of interest is the application of machine learning and predictive analytics to supply chain management. The use of these technologies can assist in detecting potential fraud, identifying inefficiencies, and forecasting demand accurately. Recent studies, such as "Predictive Analytics in Supply Chain Management: A Review" by Chen et al., provide an overview of predictive analytics techniques and their applications in supply chain management.

Additionally, the topic of supply chain resilience has gained attention in recent years, especially in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding how to build and maintain a resilient supply chain can help mitigate risks and disruptions. Research such as "Supply Chain Resilience: A Conceptual Framework and Future Research Agenda" by Pettit et al., provides insights into the concept of supply chain resilience and potential strategies for building resilient supply chains.

## DATA

The Dataco Supply Chain data comprises a rich collection of features that provide a comprehensive view of the supply chain operations of the company. The dataset includes 53 features that cover various aspects of customers, orders, products, and locations.

Some of the key features of the dataset include Delivery status, late delivery risk, category name, order country, order city, order date, shipping mode, shipping date, order status, product name, customer details, product price, and product status. The Delivery status feature indicates whether the delivery was successful or not. The late delivery risk feature helps to identify the likelihood of a late delivery. The category name feature provides information on the type of product ordered, while the order country and order city features provide information on the geographic location of the order. The order date feature captures the date the order was placed, while the shipping mode and shipping date features capture information on the mode and date of shipping. The order status feature indicates whether the order has been fulfilled or not. The product name feature captures the name of the product ordered, while the customer details feature provides information on the customer who placed the order. The product price feature captures the price of the product, while the product status feature indicates whether the product is available or not.

To analyze the Dataco Supply Chain data, the data is imported and wrangled to make it suitable for analysis. The data import process involves bringing the data into a software environment(RStudio). The wrangling process involves cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for analysis. This involve converting categorical data to numerical data to ensure consistency across different features.

Once the data has been imported and wrangled, various data analysis techniques is applied to gain insights into the supply chain operations. These may include descriptive statistics, data visualization, and machine learning techniques such as regression analysis and classification analysis. The insights gained from analyzing the data is used to optimize supply chain operations, detect potential fraud, and improve the overall efficiency of the company's supply chain operations.


## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

During the exploratory data analysis phase, a range of visualization techniques were employed to obtain insights from the data. Continuous variables were visualized using histograms and density plots, while categorical variables were visualized using bar plots and pie charts.

In the preliminary analysis for fraud detection, it became apparent that the target variable, "y_fraud," was imbalanced, with the majority of observations classified as non-fraudulent. As a result, a stratified sampling method was utilized to divide the data into training and testing sets.

Two statistical methods were considered for modeling: logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The logistic regression model was refined by removing variables with high collinearity with other variables.

To predict the Late_delivery_risk variable, several statistical methods were explored, including logistic regression, random forest, Naive Bayes, and decision tree models. These models were chosen due to their common use in classification problems and their strong performance in similar contexts.

The predictive models were evaluated using a confusion matrix to determine the number of accurate and inaccurate predictions, as well as metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure.


## DATA ANALYTICS

In this section, a comparison is made between the different models used to predict late deliveries and fraudulent activities to identify the best fitting model.

Four classification models were used to predict the factors affecting late deliveries. Initially, logistic regression, naive Bayes, and decision tree models were utilized, yielding accuracy scores of approximately 71%. However, the random forest model resulted in an accuracy score of approximately 40%, indicating that it was not a good fit for the dataset. Overall, the results demonstrated that the supply chain dataset could be accurately classified using these methods for late deliveries.

The decision to use logistic regression for fraud prediction was based on the nature of the problem, as a binary classification model was required to predict whether a transaction was fraudulent or not. Logistic regression is a commonly used and powerful method for binary classification, making it a suitable choice for this problem. The decision to use LDA was also based on the nature of the problem, as LDA is a classification method that works well when the classes have a linear boundary and assumes that the predictor variables are normally distributed. These assumptions were deemed appropriate for the supply chain dataset. The conclusions were reached by carefully analyzing the visualizations and statistical results. Logistic regression was found to have an accuracy of around 97%, similar to LDA which had an accuracy of 96%.

After evaluating the performance of the different models, it was concluded that logistic regression, naive Bayes, and decision tree models were similarly accurate in predicting late deliveries. However, the random forest model was found to perform poorly and was not as accurate. Similarly, logistic regression and LDA were the most accurate in predicting fraudulent activities, while support vector machine and decision tree models performed poorly and were not as accurate.


## NARRATIVE AND SUMMARY

The data available for analysis is highly valuable and can be used to boost revenue and improve customer satisfaction. It can also be used to identify factors affecting delivery times and prevent fraudulent activities, thus minimizing financial losses and reputational damage.

To justify the accuracy of the predictions made using the data, different models were evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure. The logistic regression and LDA models used for fraud prediction had high accuracy and F-measure, indicating that they were able to correctly predict most fraudulent and non-fraudulent cases. Similarly, for Late_delivery_risk prediction, logistic regression, random forest, Naive Bayes, and decision tree models were evaluated, and the model with the highest performance was selected as the final model. Logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and decision tree performed relatively well.

However, it is important to acknowledge that the analysis has certain limitations, such as possible errors in data collection or incorrect data. Additionally, while the data provides insights into past performance, it may not accurately predict future performance. Therefore, it is crucial to use the data in conjunction with other sources of information and approach the analysis with a critical and cautious perspective.
