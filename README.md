Project Title: Supply Chain Data Analysis To Predict Late Delivery Risk & Fraud Detection
Project Description:
This R project aims to analyze supply chain data to predict late delivery risks and detect potential fraud in the supply chain process. The project utilizes data analysis techniques in R to analyze various factors such as shipment details, delivery routes, transportation modes, and historical data to identify potential late delivery risks and fraudulent activities in the supply chain.

Repository Contents:
The repository contains the following files and folders:
